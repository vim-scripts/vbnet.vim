Although VB.NET is really just a new version of VB, the differences seemed large enough to warrant new syntax highlighting.  Nonetheless, this file aims to be backwards compatible with classic VB, although some deprecated VB syntax may be flagged as an error.

Folding is supported. Try ":set foldmethod=syntax".

I haven't done any VB since that one semester in college. I'd appreciate someone taking over this file and submitting it to be included in Vim. I believe it to be a rename and :%s/vbnet/vb/g away from being a far superior replacement for the vb.vim included with Vim, but it is terrible at VBScript, which vb.vim also handles.
